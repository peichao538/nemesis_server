Nemesis servers (audit, broker, cipher, keys)

*Status (master branch) 14 October 2013: Not operational.  
  Work is in the Development branch but this branch will
  only deploy servers and setup a foundation for the 
  application.

  This is part of my DevOps-first philosophy, where the 
  beginning of any project should be establishing a very
  solid and reproducible platform before developing the 
  application.  By doing this, the project is guaranteed
  to maintain synchronization between dev, qa, stage and
  prod environments over time--reducing the amount of 
  problems during the project lifetime.
