# Nemesis NGINX Broker Front-end Server Configuration
# Â© 2013 Sam Caldwell.  All Rights Reserved.
#
# NGINX acts as a front-end load balancer for the 
# Nemesis Broker Web Service. 
#
# Functions:
#     -Listens on tcp/80 (HTTP) and tcp/443 (HTTPS)
#     -Redirects tcp/80 to tcp/443.
#     -Load balances tcp/443 across node.js upstream processes.
#      based on least connections.
#
# *Load Balancing Strategy:
#	Direct tcp/443 traffic to http://node:100xx based on least connections
#	and fails any server for 20 seconds on bad response.
