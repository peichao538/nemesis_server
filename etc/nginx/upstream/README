 #
 # The NGINX configuration creates a load balancing
 # pool (upstream) that includes a pool of servers
 # identified in this directory by the SERVER_TYPE,
 # IP ADDRESS and TCP PORT.
 #
 # Presumably these IP ADDRESSes are in the 127/8 
 # CIDR Range (see RFC3330, Special-Use IPv4 Addresses)
 # with the following expectation:
 #
 #	AUDIT:	127.0.1.0/16
 #	BROKER:	127.0.2.0/16
 #	CIPHER: 127.0.3.0/16
 #	KEYS:	127.0.4.0/16
 #
 # NOTE: The use of localhost is presumed.  However for
 # scaling purposes, there is no restriction on the use
 # of non-local IPv4 addressess.
 #
 # NOTE: IPv6 is not supported at this time.
