#
# The NGINX configuration creates a load balancing
# pool (upstream) that includes a pool of servers
# identified in this directory by the SERVER_TYPE,
# IP ADDRESS and TCP PORT.
#
# Presumably these IP ADDRESSes are in the 127/8 
# CIDR Range (see RFC3330, Special-Use IPv4 Addresses)
# with the following expectation:
#
#	AUDIT:	127.0.1.0/16
#	BROKER:	127.0.2.0/16
#	CIPHER: 127.0.3.0/16
#	KEYS:	127.0.4.0/16
#
# NOTE: The use of localhost is presumed.  However for
# scaling purposes, there is no restriction on the use
# of non-local IPv4 addressess.
#
# NOTE: IPv6 is not supported at this time.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
#	*Execute: /srv/nemesis/bin/nemesis-add-pool-server
#
#		nemesis-add-pool-server SERVER_TYPE IP_ADDR PORT
#
#	*To add a server to the pool:
#
#		The following line should be added to a "pool configuration file":
#
#			server 127.0.1.1:80 fail_timeout=20s;
#
#		The file should be named SERVER_TYPE.IP_ADDRESS.PORT.conf, for 
#		example:
#
#			/broker.127.0.2.1.80.conf 
#
#		where the files are located in--
#
#			/srv/nemesis/etc/nginx/upstream/
#
#	*Supported SERVER_TYPE values are--
#
#		audit
#		broker
#		cipher
#		keys
