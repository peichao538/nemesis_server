NEMESIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTORS
----------------------------
The following people have contributed to this project, 
supporting its development and helping keep the world
safe through better information security products 
such as Nemesis.  Without their individual and collective
support of this and other Open Source projects, the
Internet and its related technologies would not be
possible.  To each of these individuals, I personally
want to extend a warm and heart-felt thank you.
